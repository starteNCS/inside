# PIP - Point in Polygon üîç

Simple webapp to check if a point is inside, or outside of an polygon.
You can choose between two algorithms: Raycasting (Jordan) or winding Numbers

# Code
All the important code for both algorithms can be found in the `src/app/pip/` folder.
Each solution implements the `PointInPolygon` interface.
